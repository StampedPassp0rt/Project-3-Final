If they were predictive -i.e. Q1 2015 sales predicting 2015 sales reasonably well, there was a strong element of useless signal in there, since a model was using a quarter of its results to predict its results. To use Q1 2015 sales to predict total 2015 sales seems odd since you already have Q1 fully explained.\n",
